    The files we have created for it are insanely unstable and are working out kinks. What's your skill set in c++ json angelscript and compiling dlls
5. What I need currently is a c++ DLL developer mainly but welcome support in the other 2
6. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 08:24
    Honestly zero C skill beside CS fundamentals

    So what I'll task you with is editing the current barb before coming on to the unstable project of 2.0 and make your own custom AI to learn what each system does. We aren't doing any Machine learning etc
10. It's all hard coded logics and decisions

    Hey everyone, I've been building a widget suite + AI pipeline for BAR and finally put it all into words (and a repo). This is my first public project, so would love for people to check it out and poke holes in it. If you're a more experienced dev and wouldn't mind hopping into a DM or voice chat to give me some pointers, I'd genuinely appreciate it — I'm learning as I go and a second pair of eyes goes a long way. ![🔗](https://discord.com/assets/ed3a958a3bb08d4a.svg) [https://github.com/jules-Solutions/open-bar](https://github.com/jules-Solutions/open-bar "https://github.com/jules-Solutions/open-bar") ![📄](https://discord.com/assets/1edcd854c11d1317.svg) Full write-up attached as a PDF

    If you can add building in blocks instead of spread areas that's an issue we have where they waste space
26. I have an angelscript for that but it requires a lot of testing
27. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 08:32
    I was thinking about doing a ratio and area based module building system like inputs say 2x5 wind this 2x5 will be filled and then a new one will be started outside of the explosion range.
28. And always fill one x*x square with modules as efficently as possible to reduce space
29. ### MrDeadKingz![:camera_with_flash:](https://discord.com/assets/454ea1a4aa51f9d5.svg) _—_ 12.02.2026 08:34
    the only issue I can see right off the bat with that logic unfortunately, is the rate of expansion, especially when the ai is playing on a team of 7 other AI, if they do all space out by explosion range they will run out of space before being able to eat/destroy to scale to fusion/afus
30. so in my opinion their logic to build eco in a "dangerous" manner is something they should risk
31. but im not 100% sure with their logic completely, but thats something id suggest to felnious if not already incorporated, but they should eat their own low tier eco in order to afford higher tier eco
32. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 08:37
    I have that already figured out. You have a primary and a secondary defense line. Commander spawn point to middle of primary base is the ais "vector" and it gets all the metal extractors that its vector is closest to. Only works for front lanes, would need other probably circular based approach for eco/tech roles. Once assigned the ai only build in their space and use that space efficently with "minimal" walking.
33. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 08:39
    "eat their own low tier eco in order to afford higher tier eco" That would be amazing but getting that timing right is hard I think.
34. ### MrDeadKingz![:camera_with_flash:](https://discord.com/assets/454ea1a4aa51f9d5.svg) _—_ 12.02.2026 08:41
    it would be yeah, but even something as simple as like if they have even 1 afus, they should eat all their wind, it would probably need to be hard coded in some way or something, its hard though for sure
35. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 08:43
    Yeah that's why I want to kind of skip that and train it on replay data and let it fight headless mode against AI and "dynamic averaged replays". With some reinforcement learning I am curious how it would go.
36. Cause hardcoding will in the end always be exploitable.

    IMO we currently do not have even remotely enough data in replays for said training nor will it be useful as you'd have to scrub through so much "bad games" or pick through what it should look at in terms of "being good". even if you trained it in 1v1s and only on the winning outcome how would that train for 8v8s a team oriented game. I like AI and ML but those will always be limited to the data provided to them.
38. ### TheArtificer _—_ 12.02.2026 09:04
    That is very true yes. How many games are recorded?
39. ### MrDeadKingz![:camera_with_flash:](https://discord.com/assets/454ea1a4aa51f9d5.svg) _—_ 12.02.2026 09:04
    technically every replay is recorded pretty sure at least to a point
40. ### [SMRT]RobotRobert03![:camera_with_flash:](https://discord.com/assets/454ea1a4aa51f9d5.svg) _—_ 12.02.2026 09:05
    yeah but there are things like engine versions theat are too old so those get rolled off. Also every season has a new balance update which would mess with economy scaling

    Well, for a model without available training data this can be prohibitive yes. But we can pretrain the model on all available data, I.e. replays, maybe, and then continue letting it explore itself. I also doubt that you have little data available, in all the replays each player is essentially a separate data point. But yeah, this would need to be tested, I am.also not sure how well this will work.
49. Alternatively, we could incorporate ML approaches into the current AIs and not go for RL. So for instance use AI to decide which units to built, where to deploy them and whether to push, hold, raid, or whatever, assuming this can be compartmentalized. These simpler models can certainly be trained on the available data, and it's not that much work to do, but then I would probably need someone who has worked on BarbAI to make an impact.

    Hey, I just showed up here for the same reason. I wanted to know if any ML has been done to BAR yet. I just followed along your discussion and want to point out that maybe no data is needed here. Alpha-Zero and other such approaches have demonstrated that AI can learn by playing against itself. Of course this can lead to non-human play, so maybe this is still not desired. I'm an ML researcher (although my specialty isnt RL---I have worked with it though) and might be interested in helping if your interested. Feel free to PM me if you wanna get into the beans.
56. In relation to this question, what is the state of current AIs for BAR? Are they hard-coded? Has any ML been done and is it available for testing in-game? I would love if smth like AlphaStar combined with OpenAIs approach to DOTA could be made to make cooperating AIs at different skill levels. Not necessarily just as the best possible player as had been the focus so far.

    Alpha zero and others are very different creatures, it is one of the things that actually attracted me to BAR
58. The short answer, I believe is no, no one has yet built or been able to demonstrate a reasonable generalised application of such to BAR

    how fast can headless BAR run? i always suspected the the blockers for ML-trained BAR AI was either:
    1. each iteration of training would be too slow; and/or
    2. access to sufficiently strong models would either be gatekept by token(?) cost and/or lack of access to sufficient strong hardware for self-training (considering that BAR is open source and funded on donations, anything involving money would be rough i assume)
    but if anyone wants to explore an ML-driven approach, please let me know, i would also be interested in learning more and/or contributing if able

    There are a number of technical and theoretical barriers...
69. First is to decide what you actually want to achieve: part of the aspect that bores me is attempting to train an AI for a fixed map, constrained ruleset, that will likely get it to converge on a group of relatively statically optimal strategies and behaviours.

    What makes BAR interesting is that we (humans) recognise it as a singular game, while the ruleset and gameplay is so horrendously varied.

74. For the interesting challenge isn't learning to play on straights front, as long as you approximated a general build order and a handful of general sub programs you'd probably do fine

    There is a replay parser. A replay is substantially the collection of whole cmds sends. Reading data and training an ai is relatively easy... And then you have to implement the ai itself... Not easy

    And just give it Australian-esque lag as a command bottleneck :p
79. I think people overestimate the nature of the replay data
80. By which I mean the strategic interpretability of such separate from the simulation
81. Although that in itself would be an interesting theoretical question
82. If we accept that my hypothesis that the replay stream itself is probably insufficient for world class training is correct, we then fall back to the full simulation: then we need to both run it (which puts a bottleneck on hypothetical training speed/iterations), and also solve the problem of how to interface the AI with the simulation so that it can learn.

    I'm not up to speed on Dota's engine and gameplay, but I _believe_ BARs simulation is vastly more complex than the likes of starcraft 2
84. Whether that complexity melts away in the face of AI to a handful of dominant strategies and implementations is an open question...
85. But if we include balance adjustments + game rules + different game modes in the scope of the AIs problem, there's good reason to believe it won't.
86. Finally, I believe BARs reclaim and resurrection mechanics provide some interesting theoretical properties compared to many other games. Not necessarily fatal in practice, but theoretically interesting.

    Well if a replay is just a list of commands we could go super simple and just train a language model (since commands are just a language) which autocompletes. Then we could.prompt this model for x commands where x is our apm limit and voila, we have an AI that "copies" the player base. In this case the AI would be as good as the average player in a replay, so not top tier level but maybe better than BARbarian.

    Again, people misunderstand the nature of the simulation and the commands in the replay file.
89. At a ridiculously simple level, imagine a level with only two 2 units, A and B, at opposite ends of a football field. You issue a command to both of them: UNIT A MOV (0, 100), UNIT B MOV (0, -100)
90. That's it. That's the replay file.
91. Did the units fire at each other? Did they see each other? Did one or both die? When and how? Are they still alive?
92. ### Noodles![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/clan-badges/549281623154229250/2d8bea68b3152b52858942d2bc854cc7.png?size=16)![Rollenicon, German](https://cdn.discordapp.com/role-icons/762776355209084939/ecec4ed3d2e23c81471a377ca83a17a9.webp?size=28&quality=lossless) _—_ gestern um 11:36 Uhr
    Well, the question is whether when playing the game itself the player also issues these commands. If yes, then they can be used for training. If the map.layout is not jncluded in the commands then the AI would need a second vision component that can condition its modeling on the map while playing. Maybe there is also a need to somehow map the units on the map to the identifiers used in the commands, but this is still pretty simple stuff.

    How many times did they fire at each other? Which way was unit looking when it saw unit B? What was it's speed? What was it's inertia? Did it need to rotate? Did it's first fire attempt fail or succeed?

    As i mentioned up there, the complexity of BAR's simulation is somewhat greater than SC2, and the relationship between the simulation and the command list isn't appreciated deeply.
95. Ok, now you've included the map layout. How do you know if it has deformed?

    AIs don't care if the simulation is complex. In ML this is translated as the underlying ground truth being stochastic if the modeling can't capture it.

    I don't get it, why? The AI needs to be able to see what's going on whether that's video or command level and it needs to be able to control. That's it. It doesn't need all commands a player might be able to give. AIs can deal with anything. This will just limit their capability potentially.

    Nope the last point was language modeling. Essentially a model that predicts the next "word" from previous text. A model like ChatGPT. These can be conditioned on additional input like images, video or the like.

    An interesting idea, but as of yet largely unproven imo. Not as in that ChatGPT can't do next word estimations, but that it hasn't gotten to the stage of being able to be shown to sufficiently model a stateful simulation.

    That's what i mean when i separate simulation from the replay...
113. because you've got the replay, the engine, the game rules (which i can't remember if they're in the replay or not, i think they are off the top of my head), and the simulation which is the running of the replay through the engine with the application of the game rules to create a stateful simulation over time.

    Yeah the game rules can also be used as conditioning, ![🤷‍♂️](https://discord.com/assets/7b6cbb96e0ce12a0.svg) . In any case, the AI needs to see, I.e. the map and what's going on which includes the game rules and it need to control which is the commands. That's probably it.

    How good it gets is of course dependent jn the problem, but I haven't seen a problem AI can't help with. It's just that standard approaches need to be fitted to problems sometimes.

    I always like to force AI into everything, but I often give up if I can't deal with the original code or the data needing too much preprocessing. That's no fun

    The best robots there are also proper AI methods btw. And interestingly they use non-deep ML. Like DrussGT which was the top contender for a long while, I think it got replaced more recently with other proper AI solutions.
